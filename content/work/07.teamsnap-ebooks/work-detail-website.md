TeamSnap is positioning itself as a thought leader in the sports Club &amp; League management space. They offer a great product and have a lot of insight into the industry. We created 5 ebooks to distribute to folks if they gave us a little information about themselves. I designed and laid out all 5 ebooks, the landing pages, and the backend mechanism to allow us to use one thank you page and it would dynamically download which on the user landed on reducing some overhead when it came to delivering the content and tracking the user. Hey, they also got something useful for us. This project both supported the business and the user.

Here's a full list of the ebooks live:
