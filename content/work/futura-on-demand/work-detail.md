    description: 'During my research phase, I noticed that Futura was highly used during the 50s in the entertainment, music, and advertising industries. I took off running after reading Paul Renner’s quote, “…a modern typeface should express modern models rather than be a revival of previous design.” Today’s “modern” model of music is streaming audio, which is mostly accessed through mobile apps. I pushed the envelope by applying the concept of cutting edge music delivery into a type specimen book for such a groundbreaking typeface. I was especially inspired by Spotify and Pandora, both arguably leading the streaming audio revolution.'
