When tasked with the prompt to design a site for a product that was engaging, well-written, and interactive, I jumped at the chance to redesign the experience for the card game Red Flags. Their site in the current state is an off-the-shelf theme, that isn’t very interesting or engaging. The design is very clean, but doesn’t entice one to want to buy from them.

The problem was improving their site to be more visually engaging and interactive. I created a demo of the game and revamped the entire marketing and purchasing experience with both business goals and end user goals in mind.
