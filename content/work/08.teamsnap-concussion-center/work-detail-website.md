This was a simple project, a lot of fun to work on. Played with animation, flow, creating a living infographic. More importantly, this piece was beneficial to the business. Concussions are hot topic in the sports industry, we collected a lot of the content TeamSnap has for concussions and put it together in one page and it has been very successful in driving traffic to the site; users receive some good content out of it, too!
