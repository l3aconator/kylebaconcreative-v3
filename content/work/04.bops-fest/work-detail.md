PDX Jazz, the presenting organization of the Portland Jazz Festival, began operations in 2003 in preparation of the inaugural 2004 Jazz Festival. The Festival’s mandate was established as a cultural tourism initiative to celebrate February’s Black History Month by highlighting a series of jazz education and outreach programs. The main mission of PDX Jazz is to educate and create outreach opportunities to develop and inspire the next generation of jazz audiences, the audience should reflect that of a younger age bracket.

My goal for this project was to create an engaging brand to help lower the barrier to entry to jazz and make it more accessible. “Making jazz hip again” is as succinct as one can put the goal for this campaign. Increase audience attendance and awareness. As well as spark interest in a younger audience.
