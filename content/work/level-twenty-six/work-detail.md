title: 'Level Twenty Six Book Cover'

metadata:
    description: 'Level 26: Dark Origins, is a book about a white-latex-suit-wearing serial killer who is cunning, sick, demented, and twisted. Oh, and he literally contorts himself when needed. This character is always ten steps ahead of the authorities with his riddles and games. In this cover redesign, I capitalized on the antagonist’s personality as much as possible. I illustrated his brain with type; the title has a clear pathway showcasing that the serial killer had one goal for the police. The constraints of the project were to use strictly typography and a two-color printing process (with the paper being a third color). I chose paper stock that got as close as possible to a texture similar to latex.'
