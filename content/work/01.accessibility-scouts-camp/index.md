This project is for Kyle Baconâ€™s senior thesis in the Portland State Graphic Design program. It is heavily inspired by camping and scout field manuals because the forest of the digital world is a scary place and should be accessible for all. This guide is meant to get people up to speed in creating accessible Internet experience as quickly as possible in a fun and quirky manner.

This site is by no means 100% complete as of launch and a project I hope to maintain, perfect, and build upon in the future to keep up with changes in technologies and improving the learning experience. (It's also open source, so slap in a PR if you'd like.)
