Phillip DeFranco is someone I have been watching for the last 4–5 years on YouTube. I highly suggest following his various channels and SourceFed (a company he has started for news and such). Anyways, the first 3:00 minutes of this video really struck home with me. Very inspirational and something I will remember for a long time.
