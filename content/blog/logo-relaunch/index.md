Today I am relaunching Kyle Bacon Creative’s Logo with a new refresh. I've been thinking about this for years and finally decided to execute! It's a pun on ‘When Pigs Fly’. 

I am also excited to launch BaconBits, my new space to experiment with the intersection of design, AI, and code. Bit-by-bit.
